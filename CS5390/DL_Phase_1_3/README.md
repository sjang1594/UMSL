## The Requirement for phase 1 through 3.

### The following description was the requirements for the project

1. Data preparation
- Collect the images or take pictures
- If you are extracting images from a video, make sure that the images are not too easy to predict
- Crop/Resize them all to same dimensions (height = width)
- Visualize sample images and discuss the distribution of output labels
- Discuss data normalization

2. Build an overfitting model
- Using all the data (i.e. without splitting) obtain close to 100% accuracy. Build as large model as you need (with many filters and many layers).

- How does the performance (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) change when the number of filters and layers are increased/decreased?

- If you provide the output as the input (as an additional channel) what is the smallest architecture (minimum number of layers and filters) you need to overfit the data?
