## The Requirement for phase 3 through 5.
> Phase 3 is conflicted with DL_Phase_1_3.

### The following description was the requirements for the project.

3. Split and evaluate on test set
- Split your data into training, development, and test set
- Train your model using the training set, 'Earlystop' using the validation set, and evaluate on the test set
- Study the performance when the number of filters and layers are increased/changed
- Plot your learning curves and include them in your report

4. Effects of augmentation
- With the best model obtained from the previous step, apply various techniques of data augmentation (Image generators) and study the improvement in accuracy
- Plot your learning curves and include them in your report

5. Effects of regularization
- With the best model obtained from the previous step, apply various techniques of regularization (Batchnormalization, Dropout, L2 regularization, etc.) and study the improvement in accuracy
- Plot your learning curves and include them in your report
