#CS 5700 Project : Srt Division Algorithm

1. Project Usage:

To run this program, use the following command.
-	make
-	./srt [Dividend] [Divisor]
-	see the output

Existing Problem:
	When the user input binary number, you have to erase the portion of block in SRT_method.cpp(line.48).
	Otherwise it will throw an error. Otherwise, it works.

2. Project Description:
	Given two inputs [Dividend] [Divisor], using division algorithm called, Srt division algorithm can be done.
