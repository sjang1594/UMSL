## Image Registration

What is image registration? - Image registration is the process of `transforming different images of one scene into the same coordinate system`. These images can be taken at different times (multi-temporal registration), by different sensors (multi-modal registration), and/or from different view poitns. 

The spatial relationships between these imags can be rigid (translations and roataions), affine(shears for example), homographies, or complex large deformations models.

Image registration has a wide variety of applications: it is essential as soon as the task at hand requires comparing multiple images of the same scene. **It is very common in the field of medical imagery, as well as for satelite image analysis and optical flow**
