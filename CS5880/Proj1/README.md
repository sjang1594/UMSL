> Use OpenCV to create an 8-bit single-channel image of size 640 × 480 pixels. In this image, at random locations, place a square of size 100 × 100 pixels, a rectangle of size 200 × 160 pixels, and a circle of diameter 70 pixels. Your background should be black. For each object, the center pixel of the object will be white. Other pixels will be given a grayscale value as 0XFF − d where d is the distance of the pixel from the center. Make sure that you crop the objects at the borders.
If two objects overlap, the object being drawn later takes precedence. Call your executable objects. Make sure you
display the image on screen.
